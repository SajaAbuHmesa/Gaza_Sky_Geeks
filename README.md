# ðŸ“˜ Pre-Course Task: Data Structures Challenges

Welcome to the **Pre-Course Task** repository! This project contains a set of foundational challenges designed to strengthen your understanding of two core data structures: **Stacks** and **Linked Lists** â€” implemented in Dart.

## ðŸ§  Challenges Overview
### ðŸ“¦ Stacks
These problems help build intuition around stack-based logic and LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) behavior.

**Challenge 1: Reverse a List**
Use a stack to reverse the contents of a list and print them.

**Challenge 2: Balance the Parentheses**
Validate if a string contains properly balanced ( and ) characters.

## ðŸ”— Linked Lists
These exercises test your understanding of pointer manipulation and list traversal.

**Challenge 1: Print in Reverse**
Recursively or iteratively print the contents of a linked list in reverse.

**Challenge 2: Find the Middle Node**
Efficiently identify the middle node using the slow/fast pointer approach.

**Challenge 3: Reverse a Linked List**
Reverse the direction of the linked list by adjusting the next references.

**Challenge 4: Remove All Occurrences**
Remove all nodes containing a specific value from the list.
